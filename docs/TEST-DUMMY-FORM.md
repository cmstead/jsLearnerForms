# JS Learner Forms &mdash; Test Dummy Form #
#### The Explanation ####

Things start changing here. Up to this point you were concerned with altering code to make tests pass. The tests guided you where to go. Now you will be given functioning code, and be expected to write the tests to verify it is functioning.

You can also look at [JS Learner Forms documentation](../FORMS.md) for other forms.

You will be working in the [test/4_test-dummy-form.test.js](../test/4_test-dummy-form.test.js) file.

## Why would I write tests for code I know works? ##

There are two main reasons:


### Understanding ###

By writing tests for this code, you will gain understanding of _how_ to write tests. This will show you one of the common frameworks and enough that you will be able to find your way around other common frameworks.
    

### Regression ###

The biggest reason to test a known working code base is to ensure that it stays working. You will see by testing this code base that coming into a code base you do not understand and gaining that understanding is hard work. Having tests around that code ensures that someone unfamiliar with, or has been away to long from, the code base does not accidently break existing functionality.
    
    

## A word about hints ##

This section is doable without the hints. it is _hard_ but doable. However, the only hints that make sense will make the exercises really easy. Try first without them, but do not let yourself become too stuck.
