                This is the second form. In this form we are no longer focusing directly on writing new code. Instead,
                we are looking at modifying the existing code to do the same work but with new functions and techniques. The prior tests are still passing.  The goal is to modify the code without failing previously passing tests.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you work through second form it will be worthwhile to research new concepts and Javascript functions
                as they are introduced. You will know you have become proficient with second form as you research less
                and make the code modifications naturally through "muscle memory."
            </p>
            <p>
                All red tests are validating your code against an expectation of format and vocabulary. Once you have made the appropriate modifications, the new failing tests will turn green.
