### Get product count by sale

You will be testing that the `getProductCountBySale` works correctly. (Don't worry it does, but you have to prove it.)

There are a series of tests already layed out for you. We will approach each one individually.

#### It returns an empty object for sale counts if no sale data exists

This first test ensures that the `getProductCountBySale` function works properly if you give it nothing to do. So when you give it an empty array, it should return an empty object.

The process you will follow is:

1. Enable the test
2. Add guide comments
   1. Act
   2. Assert
3. Implement the act
4. Implement the assert
5. Remove Guide comments

##### Enable the test

Each test case is defined by an `it` block. The format for an it block is as follows

```javascript
    it('has a description here', testFunction);
```

The description is the name of the test. The test function, can be a function name, a function expression, or an arrow function expression. For this exorcise use the arrow function expression like bellow.

```javascript
    it('does some thing', () => {});
```

This will cause the test to pass. However it is a false positive as this test does nothing.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>

The `it` already exists on line 51, all you need to do is add the arrow function expression. The description is the name of the parent section without then "It":

> returns an empty object for sale counts if no sale data exists

<details><summary>Code</summary>

**Example**

```javascript
    it('returns an empty object for sale counts if no sale data exists', () => {});
```

</details>

</details>

##### Add Guiding Comments

To the arrow function expression, you will add the following comments

```javascript
// Act
// Assert
```

These represent the logical steps of testing such a simple thing. We will then use the comments to implement the test.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>

You will need to add two line brakes to the arrow function expression between the curly braces.

<details><summary>Code</summary>

**Example**

```javascript
    it('returns an empty object for sale counts if no sale data exists', () => {
        // Act
        // Assert
    });
```

</details>

</details>

##### Implement the act

The "Act" refers to the action under test. You will need to do the thing the test is trying to test. So with this test you are trying to test what will happen when `getProductCountBySale` method on the `pointOfSaleDataUtilities` object is called with an empty array.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>

You need to make a call the the `getProductCountBySale` method with an empty array and set a variable to that result.

<details><summary>Code</summary>

**Example**

```javascript
    it('returns an empty object for sale counts if no sale data exists', () => {
        // Act
        let result = pointOfSaleDataUtilities.getProductCountBySale([]);
        // Assert
    });
```

</details>

</details>

##### Implement the Assert

Now you need to validate that the result to the call of `getProductCountBySale` returns an empty object.

> Note: an empty object in JavaScript is an object with no properties or methods. i.e `{}`

You will use the `assert.deepEqual` method to prove this. This method has the following signature:

```javascript
assert.deepEqual(actualResult, expectedResult)
```

<details><summary>Hints</summary>

The expected result is `{}`.

<details><summary>Code</summary>

**Example**

```javascript
    it('returns an empty object for sale counts if no sale data exists', () => {
        // Act
        let ? = pointOfSaleDataUtilities.getProductCountBySale([]);
        // Assert
        assert.deepEqual(?, {});
    });
```

</details>

</details>

##### Remove Guide comments

Now delete then comments as they provide no extra value.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>

Delete the comment lines

<details><summary>Code</summary>

**Example**

```javascript
    it('returns an empty object for sale counts if no sale data exists', () => {
        let ? = pointOfSaleDataUtilities.getProductCountBySale([]);

        assert.deepEqual(?, {});
    });
```

</details>

### It returns an object with a single count of 1 when only one item, quantity 1 was purchased

The next test is to test what happens when a only one item is passed to the `getProductCountBySale` method and it is a sale with only one item sold of that product.

It will then return an item with a property equal to the product ID with an integer value equal to that item's quantity. So if `productId: 42` was passed you should get an item that looks like:

```javascript
{
    [42]: 1
}
```
