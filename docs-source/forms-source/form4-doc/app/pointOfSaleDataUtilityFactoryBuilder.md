This will build the utility that calculates counts for items based on their transaction status.

This function takes a single parameter `transactionStatuses` that allow the status to be configured. The `transactionStatuses` object is expected to have two properties

`Sale` which is a constant number that maps to transactions caused by the sale of product. For our tests we will configure this to have the value `1`.

and

`Return` which is a constant number that maps to transactions caused by the return of product. For our tests we will configure this to have the value `2`.

These values are already set up for you.

This function returns an object with two methods.

#### Get Product Count by Sale ####

This method takes the parameter `transactionRecords` which is an array of transaction records. Each record is expected to have the following shape:

```javascript
{
    productId, // integer number unique to the product
    transactionStatus, // integer number representing Sale or Return
    quantity // integer number representing the total number of the item sold or returned
}
```

It will return an object who's properties will be the productIds of all items that were sold in the `transactionRecords`. Those properties will hold the total of all quantities sold.

**Exaple**

Given

```javascript
const transactionRecord1 = {
    productId: 3,
    transactionStatus: 1
    quantity 2
};

const transactionRecord2 = {
    productId: 3,
    transactionStatus: 1
    quantity 3
}

const transactionRecord3 = {
    productId: 6,
    transactionStatus: 1
    quantity 4
}
```

The result should look like the following:

```javascript
{
    3: 5,
    6: 4
}
```

Because there is a total of 5 items sold of Product ID 3, and only 4 items sold of Product ID 6.

#### Get Product Count by Return ####

This method takes the parameter `transactionRecords` which is an array of transaction records. Each record is expected to have the following shape:

```javascript
{
    productId, // integer number unique to the product
    transactionStatus, // integer number representing Sale or Return
    quantity // integer number representing the total number of the item sold or returned
}
```

It will return an object who's properties will be the productIds of all items that were returned in the `transactionRecords`. Those properties will hold the total of all quantities sold.

**Exaple**

Given

```javascript
const transactionRecord1 = {
    productId: 3,
    transactionStatus: 2
    quantity 1
};

const transactionRecord2 = {
    productId: 3,
    transactionStatus: 2
    quantity 2
}

const transactionRecord3 = {
    productId: 6,
    transactionStatus: 2
    quantity 5
}
```

The result should look like the following:

```javascript
{
    3: 3,
    6: 5
}
```

Because there is a total of 3 items returned of Product ID 3, and 5 items returned of Product ID 6.
