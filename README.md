## Introduction ##
The concept of forms was borrowed from martial arts. Instead of solving new problems over and over in hopes that the language will stick, a form is intended to be repeated movement for movement to develop a relationship with the language and practices of a fluent developer. The student at each form level will learn to identify syntactic patterns while following an intentional and regimented process to promote fluency through a repeated process.

A student of any form will know they are ready to move to the next form when they can demonstrate proficiency in the current form by applying the techniques presented without referring to the example materials. No two programmers are alike so it is understood that the steps someone would follow may vary slightly. This variance is good as it demonstrates a deeper understanding of the ideas presented in the form.

All of the first three forms will use the same tests and will address the questions posed in the tests in the same order. For any proficiency check, the student will be expected to work through the tests by reading them and then providing an appropriate response.

As a student becomes more conversant in a particular form, they are encouraged to apply their knowledge using code katas, like the problems provided by [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/).

## Environment Setup ##


### Environment Setup ###

To use JS Learner Forms, you will need to do the following:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Download and unzip the JS Learner Forms:
    - Download: https://github.com/cmstead/jsLearnerForms/archive/master.zip
    - After downloading, double-click the zip file in your downloads directory
    - Copy the unzipped files to a directory/folder you can remember and find later

    

### Forms Setup ###
- Set up project
    - open a terminal/command line
    - go to the directory where the JS Learner Forms project is stored
        - Windows: `cd c:\path\to\jsLearnerForms`
        - Mac: `cd /path/to/jsLearnerForms`
    - Run the setup script: `npm run setup`

    

For a video walkthrough of the setup process, check out the following video:

## Using JS Learner Forms ##


### Running a Form ###
1. Open a terminal/command line in the JS Learner Forms directory (like when you ran the setup)
2. Run the start script: `npm start`
3. Select run from the main menu
5. Choose the form number (start at 1 if this is your first time)
6. Start Visual Studio Code
7. Open the folder you cloned JS Learner Forms to in your editor
8. Open the test and source files:
    - Test files are found in the `test` directory
    - Source files are found in the `jsforms-source` directory

    

### Starting a Form Over ###
1. From the start script menu, select the reset option.
2. Choose the form number to update

    

### Solving Each Form ###
1. [Documentation For all Forms](https://github.com/jason-kerney/jsLearnerForms/blob/documentation/FORMS.md)
2. First Form -- Write code to pass each test
   1. [First Form Documentation](https://github.com/jason-kerney/jsLearnerForms/blob/documentation/docs/FIRST-FORM.md)
3. Second Form -- Update code to pass new tests, keep old tests green
   1. [Second Form Documentation](https://github.com/jason-kerney/jsLearnerForms/blob/documentation/docs/SECOND-FORM.md)
4. Third Form -- Update code to pass new tests, keep tests old green
   1. [Third Form Documentation](https://github.com/jason-kerney/jsLearnerForms/blob/documentation/docs/THIRD-FORM.md)
5. Test Dummy Form (Fourth Form) -- Write tests matching each description and get all of the code under test (modify ONLY the test code)
   1. [Test Dummy Form Documentation](https://github.com/jason-kerney/jsLearnerForms/blob/documentation/docs/TEST-DUMMY-FORM.md)
6. Async Form -- Write code to pass each test; don't forget the refactoring steps!
   1. Documentation TBD
7. Async Test Dummy Form (Sixth Form) -- Write tests matching each description and get all of the code under test (modify ONLY the test code)
   1. Documentation TBD
