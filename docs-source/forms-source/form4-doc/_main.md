Things start changing here. Up to this point you were concerned with altering code to make tests pass. The tests guided you where to go. Now you will be given functioning code, and be expected to write the tests to verify it is functioning.

You can also look at [JS Learner Forms documentation](../FORMS.md) for other forms.

You will be working in the [test/4_test-dummy-form.test.js](../test/4_test-dummy-form.test.js) file.
